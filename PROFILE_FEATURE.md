# Profile Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive user profile system that displays user information after login.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Page (`/profile`)
A dedicated profile page that displays:
- **User Avatar**: Shows user's initials in a circular avatar
- **Personal Information**:
  - Full Name
  - Username (if available)
  - Email address
  - Phone number
  - Account creation date
- **Account Details**:
  - Unique Account ID
  - User Role (Student/Teacher/Management) with descriptions
  - Approval Status with explanations
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Color-coded role badges (Blue for Students, Green for Teachers, Purple for Management)
  - Color-coded approval status badges (Green for Approved, Yellow for Pending, Red for Rejected)
  - Gradient header background
  - Professional card-based layout

### 2. Navigation Updates

#### Desktop Navigation
- **User Menu Dropdown**: Appears in the top-right when logged in
  - Shows user's full name
  - Displays user role
  - Links to:
    - Profile page
    - Dashboard page
  - Logout button (red text)

#### Mobile Navigation
- **User Info Section**: Appears at the top of mobile menu when logged in
  - Shows user's full name and role
  - Quick access buttons for Profile and Logout

#### Dynamic Navigation
- **When Not Logged In**: Shows "Login/Signup" link
- **When Logged In**: Hides "Login/Signup", shows user menu instead

### 3. Authentication Integration
- Wrapped entire app with `AuthProvider` for global auth state
- Navigation automatically adapts based on login status
- Profile page redirects to login if accessed while not authenticated
- Logout functionality available from both desktop and mobile menus

## Usage Instructions

### For Testing
1. **Login** using one of the demo accounts:
   - **Student**: Phone `1111111111` or ID `RJC20251000`, Password: `demo123`
   - **Teacher**: Phone `2222222222`, Password: `demo123`
   - **Management**: Phone `3333333333`, Password: `demo123`

2. **After Login**:
   - Notice the navigation changes (user menu appears, Login/Signup link disappears)
   - Click on your name in the top-right to open the dropdown menu
   - Select "Profile" to view your profile page
   - Or navigate directly to `/profile`

3. **Profile Page**:
   - View all your account information
   - See your role and approval status
   - Use the Logout button to sign out

4. **Logout**:
   - Click logout from the user dropdown menu (desktop)
   - Or click the logout button in the mobile menu
   - You'll be redirected to the login page

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` - Complete profile page component

### Modified Files
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added AuthProvider wrapper and Profile route
- `client/src/components/header.tsx` - Updated navigation with auth-aware UI

## Technical Details

- **Authentication**: Uses existing auth system with session management
- **State Management**: React Context (AuthProvider) for global auth state
- **Routing**: wouter for client-side routing
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui components (Card, Avatar, Badge, DropdownMenu, etc.)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design
- **Data Flow**: 
  - Login → Set session → AuthProvider fetches user data → Navigation updates
  - Profile page reads user from AuthProvider context
  - Logout → Clear session → Reset auth state → Redirect to login

## Security Considerations
- Profile page requires authentication (redirects to login if not authenticated)
- Password is never displayed on profile page (filtered out by backend)
- Logout properly clears session and resets client state

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- Add profile editing functionality
- Add profile picture upload
- Show additional role-specific information
- Add activity history/timeline
- Integrate with dashboard features
