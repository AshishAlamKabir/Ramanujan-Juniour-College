Admin Full Workflow – Website Management and Operational Controls

Objective:
Develop an Admin Portal that enables the administrator to seamlessly execute institutional management operations — including student approval, fee management, timetable scheduling, notice updates, and website content synchronization — all accessible post-login within a unified dashboard.

Prompt Script:

“After successful authentication as an Admin, redirect to the Admin Control Dashboard.
The Admin panel should serve as the nerve center for all operational and website management workflows.

Functional Requirements:

Student Approval System:

Display a table of pending student registration requests.

Options: Approve, Reject, or Hold.

Update database status instantly upon action.

Auto-refresh the view post-action with a toast notification (‘Student approved successfully’).

Fee Structure Management:

Provide editable form fields for fee categories (Tuition, Lab, Hostel, Transport).

Enable CRUD operations on fee data.

Display current fee structure with last modified timestamp.

Save all updates via backend API /api/admin/update-fee.

Timetable Management:

Upload or edit the timetable (support PDF or Excel formats).

Display current timetable in preview mode.

Option to push updates to the website so students and teachers see real-time changes.

Notice Board Management:

Enable creating, editing, and deleting notices.

Fields: Title, Description, Date, Author, and Attachment (optional).

Publish to frontend via API endpoint /api/admin/notice.

Include search and filter options for past notices.

Website Management & PDF Uploads:

Provide a section to upload PDFs, circulars, academic reports, and event announcements.

Integrate file storage (e.g., Firebase Storage or local /uploads directory).

Automatically reflect uploads on the main website’s “Resources” or “Downloads” page.

Visibility & Real-Time Updates:

Implement live synchronization so website updates (fee structure, notices, timetable) are reflected in real time.

Utilize WebSocket, Firebase Realtime DB, or polling every 60 seconds for update checks.

Show status indicators (e.g., “Last website update: 2 mins ago”).

User Experience & Design Guidelines:

Dashboard Layout:

Left Panel: Navigation Menu (Dashboard | Students | Fees | Timetable | Notices | Uploads | Settings)

Main Panel: Dynamic module workspace.

Right Panel: Notifications, logs, and quick actions.

Include status badges and modals for confirmation prompts.

Use icons and cards for quick navigation.

Backend Requirements:

Endpoints:

/api/admin/students (GET, PUT, DELETE)

/api/admin/fee-structure (GET, POST, PUT)

/api/admin/timetable (GET, POST, PUT)

/api/admin/notice-board (GET, POST, DELETE)

/api/admin/uploads (POST, GET)

Implement JWT-based admin authentication middleware.

Maintain activity logs for audit trail (who updated what and when).

Ensure all data updates trigger a broadcast refresh event.

Performance Enhancements:

Cache notices and timetables for fast retrieval.

Implement pagination for student and notice lists.

Integrate server logs and analytics later for performance insights.”
