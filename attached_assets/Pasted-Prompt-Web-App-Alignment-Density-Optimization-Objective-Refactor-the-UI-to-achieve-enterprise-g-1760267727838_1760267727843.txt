Prompt: Web App Alignment & Density Optimization

Objective:
Refactor the UI to achieve enterprise-grade alignment, reduce negative space, and increase information density without degrading readability or accessibility. Drive a “tighter yet breathable” layout that surfaces more actionable content per viewport.

Scope & Targets:

Global layout (headers, sidebars, content grids, cards, forms, tables, modals).

Spacing system (margins, padding, gutters, line height).

Alignment (grid adherence, component baselines, icon/text alignment).

Responsiveness across breakpoints (≥320px to ≥1440px).

Above-the-fold content utilization.

Key Directives:

Align to Grid: Enforce a consistent 4/8px spacing scale. Snap all components to the grid; eliminate drift and misaligned baselines.

Optimize Density: Reduce gratuitous whitespace by 10–20% vs. current state. Consolidate micro-gaps between adjacent components; collapse redundant vertical rhythm.

Increase In-Frame Content: Prioritize critical KPIs, filters, and primary controls above the fold. Target +15–30% more meaningful elements per viewport at ≥1366×768.

Right-Size Components: Normalize card and table row heights; cap header heights; minimize oversized paddings; use compact variants for inputs/buttons where appropriate.

Intelligent Wrapping: Prefer multi-column layouts over tall single columns; convert long forms into logical two-column groups with clear section headers.

Consistent Alignment: Align icons with text baselines; align form labels/inputs on a shared vertical axis; center empty-state visuals relative to content grid.

Responsive Rules: Define breakpoint-specific density presets (compact/standard/comfortable). Ensure no overlap, truncation, or orphaned controls at any width.

Accessibility Guardrails: Maintain WCAG AA: minimum 16px body text (or equivalent readable), 1.5 line-height for paragraphs, focus states visible, hit-targets ≥40×40 where interactive.

Hierarchical Clarity: Increase information density without creating visual noise—use typography scale, subtle dividers, and spacing tokens to preserve scanability.

No Content Loss: Consolidate and reflow; do not remove critical content or interactions.

Constraints & Systemization:

Use existing design tokens where available (colors, spacing, radius, shadows).

Standardize to a single spacing scale and apply consistently across components.

Avoid custom one-off paddings/margins; prefer tokenized utility classes.

Deliverables:

A revised layout specification with:

Updated spacing map (per component & breakpoint)

Grid definitions (columns, gutters, margins)

Component size variants (compact/standard)

Before/after screenshots or wireframes (desktop/tablet/mobile)

A concise change log highlighting key deltas and rationale.

CSS/utility diff or Tailwind class updates reflecting the new spacing/alignment.

Success Metrics (acceptance criteria):

≥15% more actionable items visible above the fold on desktop.

Zero misaligned baselines or off-grid elements across audited screens.

Perceived readability maintained or improved in stakeholder review.

No accessibility regressions (automated + manual checks).

Tone & Style:
Deliver pragmatic recommendations with measurable outcomes. Favor compactness, clarity, and consistency over ornamental whitespace.
